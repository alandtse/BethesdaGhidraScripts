"""Pure (Ghidra-free) logic for the duplicate-type deduper.

Loading a program's MS PDB alongside the CommonLib import leaves DUPLICATE types per
name -- the Ghidra auto-conflict copies (`X.conflict`, `X.conflict1`) and the
`/SkyrimSE.pdb/X` vs `/types.h/X` twins. Signatures/struct-fields that reference a
duplicate don't benefit from RE on the canonical type (132 of ~2.5k AE typed
signatures pointed at `/SkyrimSE.pdb/*` twins). The fix is to MERGE each duplicate
into one keeper with `dtm.replaceDataType(dup, keeper)`, which rewires every
reference -- so signatures finally point at the populated canonical type.

This module decides, per name-group of variants, the keeper and which to merge --
but ONLY when it is unambiguous (all variants share one size). When sizes DIFFER it
refuses and flags the group for binary verification (the established rule: the
in-memory `Memory::Allocate` size is ground truth, not CommonLib or the PDB blindly).
Kept Ghidra-free so the keeper choice is unit-testable; the driver does replaceDataType.
