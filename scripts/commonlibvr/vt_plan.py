"""Pure (Ghidra-free) planning logic for CommonLib-driven Version Tracking.

CommonLib's RELOCATION_ID(se, ae) / VariantID(se, ae, vr) give the EXACT address
of each symbol in every runtime, so we have ground-truth cross-version
correspondence (unlike Ghidra's heuristic correlators). This module decides, per
symbol, whether an existing VT association already encodes that correspondence
(confirmed), encodes a DIFFERENT one (conflict -- a correlator error to review),
or is absent (seed -- inject an exact accepted match).

Kept separate from the Ghidra driver so the decision logic is unit-testable.
