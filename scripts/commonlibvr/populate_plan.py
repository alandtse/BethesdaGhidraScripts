"""Pure (Ghidra-free) logic for the in-Ghidra population cycle orchestrator.

The cycle drives Ghidra to a fixpoint WITHOUT leaving Ghidra: each pass widens the
typed surface (thiscall), propagates concrete param/return types, then infers and
APPLIES struct-field types -- and the newly-typed fields become anchors the next
pass propagates from. This module holds the two rule-expressible decisions:

  * should_apply_field() -- whether a discovered field is safe to write into a
    /types.h struct (fill an unknown slot with a concrete same-size type; never
    clobber existing RE, never write a size-only generic);
  * coverage_delta()/is_converged() -- turn before/after coverage snapshots into a
    per-cycle progress number and decide when the cycle has reached a fixpoint.

Kept Ghidra-free so both are unit-testable; the drivers supply the live numbers.
