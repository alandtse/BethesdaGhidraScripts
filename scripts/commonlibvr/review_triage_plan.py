"""Pure (Ghidra-free) logic to TRIAGE the LLM-review queue by UNLOCK SURFACE.

The review queue ranks size-only fields by CONFIDENCE (how sure the decompiler is the
field exists). That answers "is it real?", not "is it worth my judgment?". The
incremental cycle's dependency graph answers the second question: discover_state.json
records, per class, the `refs` it dereferences. INVERT that -> the set of classes that
DEPEND ON a class T. Typing a field that anchors T makes T's layout flow into every
dependent, so the unlock surface of resolving a field in class C is the remaining
unknown-field count across C's TRANSITIVE dependents. A keystone class (many dependents,
each with unknowns) is where one LLM decision cascades; a leaf class unlocks nothing.

So we point the same propagation the dirty-tracking uses (refs intersect changed) the
other way, to fixpoint, and weight by remaining unknowns. Pointer fields rank above
scalars because only a pointer creates a new anchor; a scalar (refcount/flag) resolves
in place and propagates nothing. Kept Ghidra-free so the ranking is unit-testable; the
driver supplies the live state, queue, and per-class unknown counts.
