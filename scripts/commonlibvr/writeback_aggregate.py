"""Cross-runtime aggregation of the per-runtime write-back delta reports.

Joins the SE/AE/VR `<import>.writeback.csv` reports by CommonLib symbol name and
classifies each symbol by HOW its Ghidra-vs-CommonLib disagreement is distributed
across the runtimes it is mapped in. This turns three flat lists into a
prioritized, self-triaging write-back list.

CommonLib is iterative: a symbol often starts mapped for one runtime (SE or AE)
and gains runtime-specific addresses later, as divergences are found. So a delta
must be read relative to COVERAGE -- only runtimes where CommonLib actually has an
address (`present`) can have a verdict; the rest are ABSENT (not yet mapped), a
candidate for a future runtime-specific entry, not a gap.

The classify/aggregate functions are pure (no Ghidra, no I/O); the runner at the
bottom does the file join. Unit-tested.
