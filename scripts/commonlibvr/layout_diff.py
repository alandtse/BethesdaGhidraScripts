    pointers, which are typed as bare function-pointer typedefs, not 'struct:X *').
    Primitives of the same byte width also collapse (uint32/int32 are interchangeable
    at the ABI level and differ constantly between hand-RE and clang-generated layouts).

    struct/enum (basically every non-primitive field) failed this comparison on
    namespace spelling alone, so structs with already-correct live fields (e.g.

    normalized to 'tesform' vs 'tesform *64' and never matched, permanently
    misclassifying almost every real struct with pointer fields (the vast
    majority of them) as DIVERGENT despite already being correct.

    TOTAL size happens to stay the same (an existing member elsewhere is also off
    by the same amount, or padding absorbs the delta) -- classify()'s old

    ``Unk_84`` declaration shifted every subsequent vtable slot by one, but the
    struct's total size still matched, so the drift went uncorrected across
    however many pipeline runs happened since it was introduced.

    Deliberately lenient about what counts as "diverges" -- only offset+type-class
    disagreement or a differing field count trips it. A bare name difference alone
