"""Pure (Ghidra-free) logic for the globals harvester.

Many engine singletons live in untyped global data (`DAT_*`, an `undefined8` slot).
The decompiler can't propagate field accesses through an untyped global, so every
`[g_singleton]->+0x40` stays unknown -- and a class only reachable through a global
(never via an explicit `this` parameter) is invisible to the field discoverer. Worse
for the incremental cycle: a class can depend on another class's layout THROUGH a
global, an edge the struct-deref dependency model can't see.

The high-signal, decompiler-cheap way to type a global: a global passed as arg-0
(`this`) to a method whose param-0 is a known class C is strong evidence the global is
a `C *`. This module aggregates those `(global_addr, class, caller)` observations into
a per-global consensus type + confidence + a review rank -- the judgement call (accept
the type) is then a human/LLM decision applied authoritatively, exactly like the field
review queue. Kept Ghidra-free so the consensus logic is unit-testable; the driver does
the decompile + symbol typing.

Was independently forked as commonlibvr/globals_plan.py -- that copy turned out
functionally identical (same logic), only the docstrings/comments diverged in wording.
Merged here with no behavioral reconciliation needed.
