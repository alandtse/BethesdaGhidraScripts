"""Pure (Ghidra-free) logic for the globals harvester.

Technique adapted from alandtse's CommonLibVR fork.  Many engine
singletons live in untyped global data (``DAT_*``, an ``undefined8``
slot).  The decompiler can't propagate field accesses through an untyped
global, so a class reachable only via a global is invisible to
constructor/this-parameter discovery.

The high-signal, decompiler-cheap way to type a global: a global passed
as arg-0 (``this``) to a method whose param-0 is a known class C is
strong evidence the global is a ``C *``.  This module aggregates those
``(global_addr, class, caller)`` observations into a per-global consensus
type + confidence + review rank.  Kept Ghidra-free so the consensus logic
is unit-testable; the driver does the decompile + symbol typing.
